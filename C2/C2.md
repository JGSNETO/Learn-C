#C for Everyone: C2

### User Defined types

Enumeration:
- Nateive types: Int, float, char
- Usefull for different data but not all data
- eg: days of the week;

- Type save languages: Make debugging easier
- But type safety is "weak" in C- because of type limits and many conversions 

### Preprocessors

- Macros, libraries, Constants, Define 
- Preprocessors are programs that process our source code before compilation. There are a number of steps
involved between writing a program and executing a program C/C++.
- C source code -> Are the processors directives -(No)-> Compiler -(objective code)->Linker-> Exe
                                                 -(yes)-> Pre-processor peform action

- Main 4 types:
1. Macros: Macros are pieces of code in a program that is given some name.(#define LIMIT 5)
2. File inclusion: Tells the compiler to include a file in the source code program. (#include file_name)
3. Conditional Compilation: Directives are a type of directive that helps to compile a specific portion 
of the program or to skip the compilation of some specific part of the program based on some conditions.
#ifdef macro_name
    statement 1
    .
    .
    .
#endif 
4. Other directives:
#undef directive: Is used to undefine an existing macro. #undef LIMIT

#pragma directive: Is a special purpose directive and is used to turn on or off some features. #pragma startup or #pragma exit. 

#pragma warn: Is used to hide the warning message which is displayed during compilation. 

### Assertions 

- Assertions are statements used to test assumptions made by programmers. For example, we may use assertion to check if the pointer returned by malloc() is NULL or not. 
```
void assert(int expression)
```
